-- SQL Constraints
-- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

-- Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

-- Constraints can be column level or table level. 
-- Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level 
-- constraints apply to the whole table.

-- The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

-- 1.NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
-- 2.UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
-- 3.PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
-- 4.FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
-- 5.CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
-- 6.DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
-- 7.CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
-- 8.ENUM - SET THE SPECIFIC VALUES IN A COLUMN

 #  Joins :- its basically combined the table 
 
/* there are four types of joins
 1. inner join :- 
 2. cross join
 3. left join
 4. right join
 
 inner join  :-The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied.
 
 left join  :- This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matches rows for the table on the right side of the join. 
 
 right join  :-RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the
				join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join.
                
full join  :- FULL JOIN creates the result-set by combining results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. The result-set will contain all the rows from
				set will contain NULL values.
