DATABASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In SQL, a **database** is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for easy access, management,
and retrieval. It acts as a container for tables, views, stored procedures, and other database objects.

### Key Features of a Database:
- **Stores Data in Tables** – Data is arranged in rows and columns inside tables.
- **Ensures Data Integrity** – Uses constraints like **Primary Key, Foreign Key, NOT NULL** to maintain accuracy.
- **Supports Queries** – SQL commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` allow data manipulation.
- **Allows Relationships** – Tables can be linked using **keys** to create relational databases.
- **Manages Transactions** – Supports **commit** and **rollback** operations for safe data handling.


DBMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.
It provides an interface for interacting with databases using SQL and ensures data integrity, security, and consistency.

### Key Functions of a DBMS:
- **Data Storage & Organization** – Manages large amounts of structured data in tables.
- **Query Processing** – Allows users to execute SQL queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to manipulate data.
- **Data Integrity & Security** – Enforces constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key) and handles user access control.
- **Transaction Management** – Supports operations like **COMMIT** and **ROLLBACK** to ensure reliable database transactions.
- **Concurrency Control** – Prevents conflicts when multiple users access the database simultaneously.

### Example of Popular DBMS:
Some widely used DBMS are:
- **MySQL** – Open-source, widely used in web applications.
- **SQL Server** – Microsoft’s relational DBMS for enterprise applications.
- **PostgreSQL** – Powerful, open-source system with advanced features.
- **Oracle** – Enterprise-grade DBMS used in large organizations.


RDBMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** is a type of **DBMS** that stores data in a
**structured format** using tables with rows and columns. Unlike a general DBMS, an 
**RDBMS enforces relationships between tables** using keys, making it ideal for
organizing and querying structured data efficiently.

### Key Features of RDBMS:
- **Tables & Relationships** – Data is stored in tables and connected using **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.
- **SQL Support** – Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying, updating, and managing data.
- **Data Integrity & Normalization** – Enforces **constraints** to maintain accuracy and reduce redundancy.
- **Transactions & ACID Properties** – Ensures **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability** for safe data management.
- **Multi-user Access & Concurrency Control** – Allows multiple users to access the database while maintaining consistency.

### Example: How Tables Are Related in RDBMS
Imagine two tables in a **Sales Database**:

#### **Customers Table**
| CustomerID | Name   | City   |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 101       | Alice  | Delhi  |
| 102       | Bob    | Mumbai |

#### **Orders Table**
| OrderID | CustomerID | Product   |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| 201     | 101        | Laptop    |
| 202     | 102        | Phone     |

Here:
- **CustomerID** is a **Primary Key** in the Customers table.
- **CustomerID** acts as a **Foreign Key** in the Orders table, linking customer purchases.
