WHAT IS DBMS AND RDBMS IN SIMPLE TERM
-------------------------------------------------------------
DBMS and RDBMS are two types of systems used to manage and organize data, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different structures.

DBMS (Database Management System):
Definition: A DBMS is software that allows you to create, manage, and manipulate databases. It provides tools for storing, retrieving, and managing data in a database.


RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
Definition: An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that organizes data into tables that are related to each other based on common fields. It uses a structured query language (SQL) for database access and manipulation.


DBMS: General system for managing databases.

RDBMS: Specialized DBMS that uses a relational model to structure data into tables with relationships.
