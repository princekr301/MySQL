What is Normalization in SQL ?
Normalization, in this context, is the process of organizing data within a database (relational database) 
to eliminate data anomalies, such as redundancy.

In simpler terms, it involves breaking down a large, complex table into smaller and simpler tables 
while maintaining data relationships.

Normalization is commonly used when dealing with large datasets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First Normal Form (1NF)
This normalization level ensures that each column in your data contains only atomic values. Atomic values in this context
means that each entry in a column is indivisible. It is like saying that each cell in a spreadsheet should hold just 
one piece of information. 1NF ensures atomicity of data, with each column cell containing only a 
single value and each column having unique names.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second Normal Form (2NF)
Eliminates partial dependencies by ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key. What this means, in 
essence, is that there should be a direct relationship between each column and the primary key, and not between other columns.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third Normal Form (3NF)
Removes transitive dependencies by ensuring that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key. 
This level of normalization builds on 2NF.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
This is a more strict version of 3NF that addresses additional anomalies. 
At this normalization level, every determinant is a candidate key.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
This is a normalization level that builds on BCNF by dealing with multi-valued dependencies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
5NF is the highest normalization level that addresses join dependencies. It is used in specific scenarios to further 
minimize redundancy by breaking a table into smaller tables.
